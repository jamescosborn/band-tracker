@* 1) Why can't I use .Id in this for loop? I need another way to route to Delete. Why does it work for Update but not Delete? Same routing convention*@

@* 2) My update function isn't working quite right. Is there a problem with the syntax, or how I'm using the new name received from the Update form? *@

<ul>
<li><p><a href='/venues/add/band'>Add a NACHO</a></p></li>
<li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
</ul>
